## Devhub Docs

Devhub docs are generated using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/). To get setup, run:
- `pip install mkdocs`
- `pip install mkdocs-techdocs-core`

_If you get a dependency issue, e.g 'No module named '\_ctypes', you may have been missing dependencies when python was installed. Install the dependencies, in this case `sudo apt-get install libffi-dev`, update python. If using asdf, you can reinstall the python version in the .tool-version file._

Then run `mkdocs serve` to see the site locally.
