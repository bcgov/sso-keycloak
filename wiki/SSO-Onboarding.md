----------------------------------

## Making a Request

### Use the [Common hosted Single Sign on
(CSS) App](https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests/). If you are looking for integration for IDIR login, the process is completely self-serve and takes only minutes. You will need an IDIR to log in and you _should_ be a product owner, product admin, or team lead for a project. Once the automated provisioning is complete, your client details will be available securely through the web app (*)

(*) Note for BCeID Requests
The Pathfinder SSO team will provision your DEV and TEST clients right away. You will be provided with the client name and secret for each environment via a secure channel. The PROD client will be provisioned upon approval from the IDIM team.

(*) Note for Azure IDIR Requests
Please note the provisioning process is the same as IDIR.

### Need to host your application on the BC Gov Cloud service?

Please visit [BCGov Cloud Services](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/)

## Start Using your OIDC Client Configuration

Once you have your client details, you can configure your application to use the service for your application login. For helpful advice on integration see [Using Your SSO Client](https://bcgov.github.io/sso-docs/category/getting-started) or **if you are eager**, check out our [keycloak example apps](https://github.com/bcgov/keycloak-example-apps)
